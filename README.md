- `src/kernel/`: Kernel implementation (scheduling, memory management).
- `src/quantum/`: Quantum AI for scheduling optimization.
- `src/gen_ai/`: Generative AI for UI generation.
- `src/include/`: Header files.
- `build/`: Compiled binaries.
- `scripts/`: Build and run scripts.
- `tests/`: Unit tests.
- `docker/`: Docker configuration for DevOps.
- `logs/`: System logs.
- `.github/workflows/`: CI/CD pipeline.

## Tools
- QEMU: For emulation.
- GCC/NASM: For compilation.
- Python: For Quantum AI (Qiskit) and Generative AI (Hugging Face).
- Docker: For automation.

## Status
Under development. Currently setting up the initial structure and Kernel.
